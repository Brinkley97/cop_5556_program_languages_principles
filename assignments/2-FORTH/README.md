## Assignment 2

In this assignment, I implement various function in the functional programming type called  `Haskell` while integrating the workflows around `cabal`, the package/builder manager. Test cases are written in a stack-oriented procdural language called `FORTH (.4TH)`.

See [Requirements.md](https://github.com/Brinkley97/cop_5556_program_languages_principles/blob/main/assignments/2-FORTH/Requirements.md) to get a sense of what was expected.

Download `Haskell : https://www.haskell.org/downloads/

How to use `cabal`: https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html

## Installations

Make sure you are inside the FORTH directory and beware of other installation issues that I'm not documenting (do to how many there were).
```
cabal install
cabal install hbase
cabal install hspec --lib
cabal install quickcheck --lib
cabal install flow --lib
```

## Running the unit tests

The easiest way to run the unit HSpec tests is using `runhaskell` command
```
runhaskell ValSpec.hs
runhaskell EvalSpec.hs
runhaskell InterpretSpec.hs
```

## TODOs

1. Change the code in `Main.hs` so that, if the stack is not empty at the end of execution, a message gets printed on the screen saying so and the stack content gets printed. Make sure at least one of your test cases covers this situation.

2. Add more built-in function definitions to `Eval.hs` and write unit tests for them in `EvalSpec.hs`. The `*.out` file is the correct solution to that test case. of the code. Run each as `cabal run FORTH test/t*.4TH`
   1. `+` --- `t2.4TH` --- `t2.4out`
   3. `-` --- `t2.4TH` --- `t2.4out`
   4. `/` --- `t2.4TH` --- `t2.4out`
   5. `^`: power --- `t2.4TH` --- `t2.4out`
   6. `EMIT`: takes a number from the stack and prints the character with the corresponding ASCI code --- `t2.4TH` --- `t2.4out`
   7. `CR`: prints a new line (for nice formating) --- `t2.4TH` --- `t2.4out`
   8. `STR`: converts the argument into a string (needs to work for all types) --- `t2.4TH` --- `t2.4out`
   9. `CONCAT2` and `CONCAT3` concatenates 2 or 3 strings from the stack (errors if arguments not strings) --- `t2.4TH` --- `t2.4out`

5. Submit a `.zip` archive of your project. Before you archive, remove the dist directory (since it has a large executable in it).

## Situations you encountered

1. `t3.4TH` test case is: 2 3 - . I process this (and every input file) as 2 - 3, hence why output is -1.
2. **Bugs with inital code:** I sent first email/created a discussion thread on Mon. 24 Feb. There were no response to this via email, so I attend OH on 26th to resolve issue. Two days delay. **Follow-up questions:** I sent email on 26th (after OH). Response via email same day. I attend OH on 27th, then follow up again via email. My questions and thoughts were never answered resulting in having to rely on my own assumptions. **Grading understanding:** Given the delays and some no responses, I may not have all of what's requested, so I ask for you grade according to my assumptions.
